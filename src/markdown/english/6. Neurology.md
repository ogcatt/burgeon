Porn is not a disease in a personal sense. Porn is voluntary behavior.

You may push back against this statement, however, the mind works with benefits/negatives. You will only use porn if you see some benefit to it, and only if it is the most attractive path at one time.

So how do you stop seeing the benefit of porn? Well, porn provides instant "pleasure". And if you see a benefit in instant "pleasure" why would you not consume porn?

The thing with negative habits and negative patterns is that you cannot just pick and choose which destructive activity you keep. The root which you must dig to become free from one will also free you from the others. If one chases pleasure, and they remove porn from their life, it will just be a waiting game until they look for it again. If one chases feeling or emotion, they will feel entitled and will look for it again.

People crave image and they crave feelings. Craving image is the desire to be loved, or the desire to be superior. Craving feeling is the desire for pleasure, or the desire to take unhealthy risks. These things are the main roots of negative habits and patterns in people.

To Grow:

- For one that craves love - they need to learn to love themselves.
- For one that craves superiority - they need to have humility and sincerity to grow, otherwise, their destructive nature will turn inward.
- For one that craves pleasure - they need to understand peace and freedom are what they are really looking for.
- For one that craves risk - they need to discover their own value.

These things are the building blocks of the mind: What society, what people, base their entire lives around. However, this craving has a destructive effect on others, and themselves.

A human will normally crave, and chase for their entire life. They will build an image of perfection, of a possible utopia, where everything would be fine. All they need is to get what they have wanted. However, everything you have ever desired is right here, in the present moment. Peace is not in the future. However, chasing pleasure, and craving these things, distracts one from peace.

Craving avoids one from asking important questions. It consumes time, and it fills the mind. Yet, the reality is that if these people who crave stopped craving, they would have to face the fact that they have nothing else of substance in their life. Due to this chasing, they have made no meaningful action. And any meaningful action they may have made has been forgotten and lost to time.

**Truth hurts so the mind typically avoids it.**

This is why you can't "fix" everyone; why many people will always be consumed with bad habits and destructive activities. If one is not aligned with truth or does not have the humility to change, nothing will be done. They can read all of the "addiction recovery" books on the entire planet, and they won't change.

If you do not want to waste your time: Do not force people to change. Provide them with the door, but they must turn the key. Do not look down on people who are content with living a destructive life, however - otherwise, you place yourself above others and your vision is once again blinded. Have compassion for them.

## Fear

Emotion is our evolved biology predicting the future impact of a current event. In modern settings, it’s usually exaggerated or false. This does not mean emotion is not useful, but it is not a reliable source of information. Especially when emotion is all that you are thinking about. For example, negative thoughts usually attach themselves to everything. If somebody is only thinking negative thoughts, they will attach negativity to everything. Even if the things they are looking at have not changed, their clarity is taken away via these negative thoughts.

Fear is the destructive energy in man. It withers the mind, distorts thought, it leads to all kinds of extraordinarily clever and subtle theories, absurd superstitions, dogmas, and beliefs.

It is easy to say "you should not fear" or similar 'inspirational' quotes, but this does not do much. What makes a difference is the realization that you fear what does not yet exist, as you fear what is in your control. Do not disregard your own ability to be an individual through this fear.

Also, if you accidentally see someone naked, or you see porn (by accident), it will not create a negative dopamine effect. However, actively seeking these things does. You do not need to be afraid of watching movies where there are sexual scenes. Or afraid of lewd material being sent by some idiot. You can change your environment to where you see these things rarely - however, you do not need to fear these things. Your view completely determines their ability to impact you.

"Everyone is failing, so how isn’t it likely that I too will fail?". This is what is called, “The Failure Circle”. One person fails because they may lack humility, and then those that hear of this person’s failure get doubt and fear of failure, and thus slip up. Their slip-ups are reported within an online community and others who see them get doubt and fear as well, and it goes on and on and on. They get a false impression that it’s hard, and thus it becomes hard.

However, when one reframes the way they look at PMO use and no longer sabotaging themselves, then they do not need to care for these others. **To make progress, you must look out for yourself**. 

One thing you may do, after finding freedom, is fear losing this freedom. You can find comfort by realizing you can do whatever you want with your life. You could go back to self-sabotaging through porn. But will you? Is there any benefit to "instant pleasures"? You do not need to fear losing freedom; you can do whatever you want.

## Habitual Pathways

Habits are everything—everything we are. We are trained in habits from when we are children, including potty training, when to cry and when not to, and how to smile and when not to. These things become habits—behaviors we learn and integrate into ourselves. 

Many of our flawed beliefs and delusions are fundemental, created through childhood, influenced by our parents and people around us. If we do not make ourselves aware to these influences on our ideas, we will be a slave to the environment. These ideas could be something like: (Interacting with people = yelled at, therefore I will not interact with people) or (Nothing I do is good enough, so I won't do anything) etc.

When we’re older, we’re a collection of thousands of habits constantly running subconsciously. We have a little bit of extra brainpower in our neocortex for solving new problems. You become your habits.

However, you can change these habits and the way your mind views the world, by increasing your neuroplasticity. This takes the humility to change and to question the very things such as your ego, your current beliefs, and life direction.

"You have to take a second to sit down, to thoroughly observe your patterns. Do you move when you don't want to move? Do you get angry when you don't want to get angry? You have to fix these things about yourself, you have to give a fuck about yourself and that makes life so much better." -Jahsey.

When we make a conscious effort to change, these pathways can change. But it requires a lot of humility and it requires one to lower their ego.

## The Self-Improvement Trap

"Self-improvement" is just a dressed-up form of self-conflict.

Let's say you "self-improve" enough to where you gain your dream form; you are productive, you no longer use porn, you are physically strong, and you are confident. The thing is, after all of this "self-improvement" where is your direction? Most do not want to ask this question because they would rather be consumed by their repeated failed attempts to "self-improve".

Saying you need to improve is also saying that there is something wrong with you currently; you are not satisfactory. This thought of not being good enough looms over a "self-improver" to where they constantly feel like they are missing the mark of their ideal self. And when they fail at improving, they use bad habits to cope, so it cycles on and on.

The key, if you want to become a better version of yourself is to aim to be good. Not perfect.

And even after that, you should think about what interests you past the point of improvement. If you do not answer this question, "improvement" will be the only thing you do.

The way I look at it; I am not "improving myself" but I am just practicing life in a way that I find most satisfactory; a life that is the most purposeful. While desire does not lead to peace, I still find satisfaction in making accomplishments and finding freedom on different levels (monetary, etc).

In any case, most people doing "self-improvement" have no idea why they are practicing it. They want to be better. They want to get women. They want to be more confident. However, even though the idea of "self-improvement" is a long-term benefit, the result for these people is still short-term pleasures. Think about your reasons for being interested in "self-improvement" and you can find out many things that will likely bring clarity.

What you call self-discipline - is merely an adjustment to an environment which we have not completely understood; therefore, in that adjustment, there must be the denial of intelligence. Why has one ever to discipline one's self? instead of this avoidance, this conflict, one can understand the nature of what they create a conflict with. And then the mind will become free.

## We Guard Our Problems

Your problems become your companions. They are your pet rocks. You groom them and nurture them and secretly hope that they will never leave you. For they have become part of you. And you need them as beacons to keep you fixed to the same path you have walked for dozens of years.

For if someone truly took away your problems, you would go mad. You would not know how to function. You would be shakened from your conditioned existence. You would roam aimless in the street. Your entire life would fall apart.

With nothing to guide you, with no railroad tracks to follow, the world would explode into a sea of choices and possibilites. What would you do then? How would you choose?

Our problems help us avoid this responsibility for direction. And if we do not confront the endless possibilities that will arise once we find freedom from these problems, and only hide from them, one will be forever attached to their problems.

Once recognised, the problem of PMO becomes a direction to work towards. Once it is overcome, you are lost in your newfound freedom.

This is why it is of upmost importance for one to figure their direction. If you have no use for your freedom, you might as well not attempt to gain it.

Think on these things.
